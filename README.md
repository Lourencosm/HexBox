HexBox is an intuitive modeling method and interactive tool for creating and editing hexahedral meshes.
Hexbox brings the major and widely validated surface modeling paradigm of surface box modeling into the world of hex meshing.

> We are preparing a tutorial on how to use HexBox. Meanwhile, we print the list of commands and shortcuts in the terminal.

## Compatibility

HexBox requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.14+, a modern C++20 compiler, and OpenGL 2.0. As of today, it has been successfully tested on MSVC v143 on Windows 11, GCC 10 and Clang 14 on Ubuntu 22.10 and Clang 14 on MacOS.

## Videos, Tutorials

HexBox is meant to be a live project. On [this](videos.md) page you can find the video examples that were originally attached to the SGP submission. In the near future we will operate to create additional tutorials and tips & tricks to build a community around our tool, helping users to make the best of it.
